Create WooCommerce coupons with variable discount percentage per product

== Description ==

This plugin creates a new coupon type called ‚ÄúPercentage discount (per product)‚Äù that works just like the regular ‚ÄúPercentage discount‚Äù coupon, with a twist.
By default the percentage discount to be applied is the one set on the coupon, but you can edit any product and set a specific discount for that product / coupon.
You can also set the specific discount at the product variation level (defaults to product level if not set).

= Features: =

* One coupon: several percentage discounts
* That‚Äôs it for now

= PRO add-on (soon to be released) features: =

* Set default discount on the coupon and specific discounts per taxonomy term (instead of per product)
* Technical support
